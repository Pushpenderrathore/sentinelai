"""
OSIRIS enrichment — third-party OSINT for an address a scan turned up.

OSIRIS (osirisai.live) exposes keyless GET endpoints for passive lookups. Three
of them describe an address: /api/osint/ip (geolocation, ASN, network owner),
/api/osint/shodan (services and known vulnerabilities seen from outside), and
/api/osint/threats (reputation, Tor exit status, OTX pulses). A fourth,
/api/osint/cve, returns the upstream record for a single CVE id.

Two reasons this is a server-side module rather than a fetch from the browser:
OSIRIS sends no Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, so a page on our origin
cannot read the response; and routing it through here keeps scan targets out of
the client and lets one lookup be cached for every viewer of a report.

Only passive routes are used. OSIRIS also publishes /api/osint/sweep and
/api/scanner, which generate traffic against the named target — SentinelAI does
its own active scanning under its own authorisation checks, so those stay
unused here.

Every lookup is best-effort. The OSIRIS docs are explicit that its routes proxy
third parties and that upstream failure is normal, so a source that does not
answer is reported as absent rather than turned into a failed request.
