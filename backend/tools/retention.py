"""
Data lifecycle and retention for scan records.

A scan does not live in one place. Its row sits in scan_history.json, its
payload (vulnerabilities, patches, summary) can be offloaded to a cold archive
file, the cloned repository sits in a temp workspace, and an in-flight scan
also holds a live in-process session. "Delete this scan" therefore touches
several stores, and any of them can succeed, refuse, or fail independently.

Every operation here returns a Receipt: one result per component plus a single
rolled-up outcome, which is one of

    complete    every component reached its intended end state
    partial     the operation did what was asked, but scan data is still
                retained somewhere on purpose (a policy-retained summary row)
    blocked     a legal hold or an in-flight scan refused the operation
    unresolved  a component failed, or a store disagrees with the ledger

Receipts are appended to a hash-chained audit ledger so the record of what was
erased cannot be edited after the fact without detection.
